# ShirtsAPI
This API was developed with MuleSoft in Design Center and AnypointStudio to test my new learning on APIs development.

<br />

## Branches

- <strong>main</strong> = Contains the API developed in AnypointStudio 7.
- <strong>database</strong> = Contains the Database that I created to work with the API. I've used the MySQL Workbench to create a local connection in port 3306.
- <strong>RAML</strong> = This was the start of the project, before creating the flows, I created the RAML in design center and then imported to AnypointStudio and proceeded with the development.
